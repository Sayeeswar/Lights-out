# Security Guidelines

## Secrets

- NEVER hardcode API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials in any file
- Always use environment variable references: `${VAR_NAME}` or `process.env.VAR_NAME`
- Never echo, log, or print secret values to the terminal

## Permissions

- Never use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or `--no-verify`
- Do not run `sudo` commands
- Do not use `rm -rf` without explicit user confirmation
- Do not use `chmod 777` on any file or directory

## Code Safety

- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Sanitize HTML output to prevent XSS
- Never execute dynamically constructed shell commands with user input

## MCP Servers

- Only connect to trusted, verified MCP servers
- Review MCP server permissions before enabling
- Do not pass secrets as command-line arguments to MCP servers
- Use environment variables for MCP server credentials

## Hooks

- All hooks must be reviewed before activation
- Hooks should not exfiltrate data or make external network calls
- PostToolUse hooks should validate output, not modify it silently

## During changes

- When making a change, do not break existing features built on top of the affected code. E.g. a frontend change must not break backend functionality.
- Keep the frontend and backend decoupled: changing the frontend for design/visual reasons must not change app behavior. All functionality lives in the backend.
- The frontend is for visual presentation only — it does not call external APIs, hold system prompts for the AI, or contain business logic. Its only job is to display data; everything else happens in the backend.
